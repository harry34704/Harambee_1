ðŸ’¡ Act as a senior full-stack developer with 10+ years of experience.

I want you to create a complete, production-ready Flask application called **"Harambee Accommodation System"** with the following specifications:

---

âœ… BACKEND:
- Use **Flask (Python)** as the backend framework.
- Use **SQLite** as the database with SQLAlchemy.
- Set up models for:
  - `Student`: name, email, password (hashed), phone, guardian info, documents (ID, parent ID, payslip, bank statement), room_number.
  - `Admin`: email, password (hashed).
  - `Accommodation`: room number, details, price.
  - `LeaseAgreement`: student_id, room_number, start_date, end_date, PDF file.
  - `MaintenanceRequest`: student_id, room_number, description, status.
- Setup JWT or session-based authentication.
- Use **Flask-WTF** for forms and **validators**.
- Integrate **Twilio** for SMS notifications.
- Integrate **ReportLab** to generate lease PDFs.
- Configure `.env` to store sensitive keys.

---

âœ… FRONTEND:
- Use **Bootstrap 5** with a modern, responsive dark theme.
- Create full-page templates:
  - **Home Page** with a professional background image and intro text.
  - **Dashboard** for logged-in students with their details and actions.
  - **Accommodation Page** to view available rooms and request maintenance.
  - **Gallery Page** with sample images of the accommodation.
  - **About Us Page** with sample text about Harambee.
  - **Contact Us Page** with contact details, icons, and Google Maps iframe.
  - **Login Page** and **Register Page** with proper form validation.
  - **Checkout Page** for Stripe payments (prepare the integration).
- Footer with social media icons and links.

---

âœ… FUNCTIONALITY:
- User registration (students) with document uploads (PDF, PNG, JPG).
- Secure login/logout.
- Admin dashboard for approving student applications.
- Lease agreement generation in PDF upon approval.
- Maintenance request submissions.
- Stripe checkout setup for accommodation payments.
- Display notifications after actions.

---

âœ… DEPLOYMENT:
- Initialize a **GitHub repository**.
- Push the entire project to GitHub as **harambee-accommodation-system**.
- Add a `.gitignore` for Python and Replit.
- Provide me with the GitHub link when done.
- Ensure the app runs on Replit with a working `.replit` and `replit.nix` config.

---

ðŸš€ GOAL:
- Deliver the entire working system in one go.
- Automatically build all required files and folders.
- Make the system fully functional and styled.
- Ask for my approval after each major section (frontend, backend, deployment).
- Do not leave placeholders â€” create complete working code.
- After development, deploy to GitHub automatically.

Begin the project now.
